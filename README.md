# Film-Finder

A Codecademy project that makes use of The Movie Database (TMDB) web API to generate random movie recommendations based on user-selected genre. 
An API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/ is needed to run this project. After obtaining an API key, add it to the tmdbKey variable on line 1 in script.js

I used VS Code's live server extension to view this project in the browser.
